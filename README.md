# Learned-Image-Compression on a Small Embedded System

This project involves a Deep Learning model that performs image compression on a small embedded system, i.e. a resource constrained environment. 
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) autoencoder is a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning tasks, such as image compression. It consists of two main parts: the encoder and the decoder.<br>
The custom model was created with model size as less as 214.73 KB. The comparison of the custom model with the existing JPEG and JPEG2000 models were also made and various conclusions were derived. The details of the custom model, its architecture, etc. can be found in the report.

### Environment/Libraries used:
Python, tensorflow keras, matplotlib, numpy

### Dataset specifications: 
Dataset used is ‘Kodak dataset’. It consists of 24 high-resolution images. The RGB images are of sizes 512x762 as well as 762x512.
